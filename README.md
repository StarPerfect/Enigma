# Enigma

## Mod 1 Final Individual Project

### Intro to the Enigma project aka My Thoughts:

I was and still am excited about the idea of this project. I've always been interested in cryptology and the original Enigma fascinated me. Since I picked the Caesar Cipher for our Mod 0 project, I was really excited to expand on that work here in Enigma. Unfortunately, I was not able to get into the Cracking aspect since I've been troubleshooting my decryption for a couple days now. I've made progress but I still can't get to the root of the problem to get past it. I am hoping during our project eval to get some insight and/or breakthroughs so I can continue to progress on this project.

### Project Strengths:

I believe TDD is my strongest area of understanding from Mod 1. I believe I also grasp the concepts of object oriented programming and single responsibility principle fairly well. This is supported by the additional classes I created to maintain adherence to SRP.

### Project Struggles:

Difficulties for me arose in trying to troubleshoot various issues while having so many moving parts. Even though I tried to keep classes to single responsibility, I feel like my classes are too closely coupled. This is probably why it was so difficult to troubleshoot. I would like to learn how to maintain single responsibility with small-sized classes while keeping them loosely coupled.

# Overall Self-Assessment

**Functionality:** 2.5 - I have been trying to troubleshoot the same decryption CLI problem for 2 days now and, despite making progress, have not been able to get it completely working to move on to the cracking. =(

**OOP:** 4 - I have two mixin modules that could be used separately elsewhere. I maintain SRP with multiple classes that are on the smaller side just to handle their responsibilities.

**TDD:** 3 -  I tried to use mocks/stubs with my random number generator but it wasn't working. I do a great job of almost always writing tests first. Simplecov coverage is excellent.

**Version Control:** 2.5 - 3 - lots of commits, although I will say that this project was harder for me to keep the version control cleaner than I have in the past due to the complexity of many interlaced parts. I'd be in a branch working on one thing when something would break then to fix it I would have to go into a few different places and make changes to try to get the problem corrected. That being said, I had a harder time keeping my work cleanly divided into the proper branch and therefore separate PRs.
